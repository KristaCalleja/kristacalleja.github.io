                <h2>GreatReader: Your Reading Cheerleader</h2>
                <p>My submission to the October 2021 SheSharp Troopl Hackathon which was voted by judges as The Most
                    Creative Solution üèÜ, landing me a paid for one-year subscription to PluralSight Skill Standard. The
                    challenge was to create a Shout-Out Generator. I took it a step further, designing a landing page,
                    and adding on more functionality by requiring the user to make a commitment. My main achievement was
                    putting together all the JS knowledge I've been working on since mid-2021. DOM manipulation, event
                    handling, arrays, loops, iterations, image sourcing, JS methods and modals. That all happens in just
                    2 clicks and less than 100 lines of JS code. I also threw in some HTML5 elements, some
                    accessibility, a couple of pseudo-elements and a touch of animations CSS. What fun and what an
                    achievement!</p>

                <h2>IP Address Tracker</h2>
                <p>A JS app through which one may search for any IP addresses/domains and see key information and
                    location. As soon as you log on to the site your IP address will be picked up and the map will
                    generate your address coordinates. If you feel like having some fun searching for some randomised IP
                    addresses click <a href="https://www.ipvoid.com/random-ip/"
                        style="text-transform: lowercase;">here</a>. With this project I practised
                    GET request, DOM manipulation, API, event handling.</p>

                <h2>Magic Write-Erase</h2>
                <p>How cool is it to build an app your own child can enjoy? This was totally fun to build and also to
                    show off to my son. It is built with Vanilla JavaScript using the Canvas Api which permits the
                    drawing of 2D graphics. For now it is only available for desktop, but my next challenge is to make
                    it responsive on mobile and tablets with touch drawing, if possible. This project was inspired by <a
                        href="twitter.com/wesbos/" style="text-transform: capitalize;">Wes Bos.</a></p>

                <p>This is a popular UX UI component, the slider, often used to represent testimonials, as is in this
                    design. Through it I practised, JavaScript Objects: use of Object Literal Syntax and Dot Notation.
                    Setting of image element sources through JS.</p>

                <h2>URL Shortening Service</h2>
                <p>Another full-stack challenge using JavaScript which you can test for yourself. Enter your long URL
                    link and get your new shortened URL. So handy! This app was built with integration with shortcde API
                    to create shortened URLs. I also used AJAX, nested functions and super useful clipboard interaction.
                    If you like this app, press Cmd+D and save to your bookmarks.</p>

                <h2>Commercial Landing Page</h2>
                <p>On the surface this looks like a very plain traditional landing page for any anonymous company. Only
                    a developer will appreciate the experiment behind this: indeed, a pretty straightforward exercise in
                    native HTML and CSS, but I decided to think out of the box and apply my knowledge in Vanilla
                    JavaScript to set the curved in-between sections. Through this experiment I
                    learned to access, read, manipulate and create rules over pseudo-elements. The JavaScript file also
                    provides for user-agent detection for purpose of media queries. Lots of fun learning!</p>
